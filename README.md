Project Description
	The outline for the proposed application is a simple motivational quotes application. I like many other people go through stressful times in life, feel burnt out, or at times confused on what to do with life. This proposed app is something simple and will be designed to help those who need a little encouragement, appreciation, or even just to feel like they are being listened to. With a “Quote of the Day” feature popping up in the GUI of the user to some back end features that allow for randomness and storage for the quotes and imagery that will be associated. 
Problem Addressing
While not inherently a business problem, the proposed app will be designed to help those who want to be reminded that everything has its reason for happening. Today’s society is stressful enough as it is, so why add fuel to the already burning fire when one can read a quote and unwind a bit. 
Platform
Seeing as this class is a mobile application development class the primary platform for this project/app will be Android. 
Front/Back End Support/Functionality
	Front end support will consist of a main screen with a random quote or piece of motivation that appears to the user as soon as everything loads and a list of categories that gives the user options to scroll through and decide what they want to read. Categories ranging from strength related text, to hopelessness, the user will have a menu to scroll through so they can decide what is best for their needs. As for the backend, there will be a form of storage system as I plan to include imagery to give more life to these quotes. I by no means am savvy with application development so changes are to be expected. 
Updated Changes
Version 1, or the previous version. The application has a UI that has three main elements which are: the “quote of the day”, a button for navigating to the categories, and another button for the user’s favorites. As the user navigates to said categories they will be greeted with the categories that the application offers. The original wire frame is simple–bland even. As the user selects the desired category they are moved to the category UI where a quote is displayed. 
Version 2, updated. 
Changes to the menu UI
The UI will now shuffle through the quotes that are saved on the applications database if the user decided to stay on the menu. 
Changes to ‘Categories’ UI
Organization of the categories will be changed to a column-like organization to better help users.
New Additions
There will be a ‘share’ feature that will allow users to share their favorite quotes to friends and family.
A shuffle button will be added to the main menu to bring about an unexpected, but pleasant surprise. 
A new feature to categorize favorite quotes.
Future version
An updated database that will allow for smoother, more efficient saving of user data and preferences
Better security as the sharing feature will be implemented
A cooperative space to share quotes among other users
A creative workspace to publish and discuss user’s quotes
Summary
The updates shown for the future are bound to change, whether it’s to add or remove, but it shows some promise. Users will be able to navigate the application easier and will have more room to be creative with the future implementation of a creative workspace. For the database, more research is being conducted to ensure information is kept with the utmost integrity, safety, and efficiency. The application is not aimed to be complicated, the goal is to help those who need to read or hear words to lift them up.
